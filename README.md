#Rasputin Labs presents BlackMail as a Service (jk)

This is the representation of the final set of services and stack for the app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RasputinLabs/blackmail-beta .
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

A few notes:
This stack is a work in progress and honestly isn't entirely representational of a production-ready app. That being said, it's meant as a learning resource and a working example. There are lots of insecure passwords. This project comes with no warranty and was cobbled together from resources across the web. If you have questions please open an issue so we can answer it here.
